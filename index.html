  <h1>Josiah Ingram</h1>
  <p>I am a Technical Writer and student at Eastern Washington University, graduating in Spring 2016. During the early years of my educational career, I joined the Washington Army National Guard, which has left me with a strong sense of purpose and duty, and given me the skills needed to survive in a professional environment. Writing is my passion, and I am currently pursuing a career as a freelance writer to give me a stepping stone into Technical Editing.</p>
